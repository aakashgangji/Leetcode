"""You are given 3 positive integers zero, one, and limit.

A binary array arr is called stable if:

The number of occurrences of 0 in arr is exactly zero.
The number of occurrences of 1 in arr is exactly one.
Each subarray of arr with a size greater than limit must contain both 0 and 1.
Return the total number of stable binary arrays.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: zero = 1, one = 1, limit = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The two possible stable binary arrays are [1,0] and [0,1].

Example 2:

Input: zero = 1, one = 2, limit = 1

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible stable binary array is [1,0,1].

Example 3:

Input: zero = 3, one = 3, limit = 2

Output: 14

Explanation:

All the possible stable binary arrays are [0,0,1,0,1,1], [0,0,1,1,0,1], [0,1,0,0,1,1], [0,1,0,1,0,1], [0,1,0,1,1,0], [0,1,1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,1], [1,0,0,1,1,0], [1,0,1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,0,1,0], and [1,1,0,1,0,0].
